			- Wiggle your toes
			</code></pre>
			<p>Have you ever felt like Linux distributions do too much? Developers often add their personal preferences to every aspect of the system which makes it difficult for some advanced users to tinker with their install without having to deconstruct it completely. And so we present to you one of the most vanilla Linux distributions out there, the fast, the minimal, ToeOS.</p>
			<p>1. What is ToeOS?</p>
			<p>ToeOS is a relatively small POSIX compliant shell script that builds a minimal Linux-based operating system from source. Since there is no installation media you will have to use an existing Linux installation to partition the disks and run the ToeOS installation script. We highly recommend you to edit this script as it is using some default values you might want to change.</p>
			<p>2. What makes it special?</p>
			<p>We believe that modern "DIY" distributions are still missing the point of actual minimalism. ToeOS uses runit as its init system, musl libc as its C library and gets its utilities from the BusyBox software suite. Additionally, it contains all the tools and packages needed to recompile this set of software. That means there is no package manager, you will have to build everything by yourself or implement one manually. This is why you should be familiar with LFS before attempting to use ToeOS.</p>
			<p>3. What are some example use-cases?</p>
			<p>Even if ToeOS is made to be a fully-functional operating system, its extreme minimalism might not be suited for everyone. Some examples of where it might be used include the embedded system, servers or even as a pocket Linux distribution that you can carry on a pendrive. But its primary goal is to be used as a way to expand your knowledge about the inner  mechanisms of Linux.</p>
