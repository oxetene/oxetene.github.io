- Wiggle your toes
</code></pre>
<p>Have you ever felt like Linux distributions do too much? Developers often add their personal preferences to every aspect of their system, which makes it difficult for some advanced users to tinker with their install without having to deconstruct it completely. And so we present to you one of the most vanilla Linux distributions out there, the fast, the minimal, ToeOS.</p>
<p>ToeOS is a collection of POSIX compliant shell scripts that build a minimal Linux-based operating system from source. We believe that modern "DIY" distributions are still missing the point of actual minimalism. Some may use runit as their init system, musl libc as their C library and believe they have a "minimal" system. ToeOS avoids all these design decisions by not having an init system, being statically linked and using toybox as its userspace. In fact, the entire system is contained inside a compressed initrd image. Some examples of where it might be used include embedded systems and servers (if you manage to configure the network properly), but its primary goal is to be used as a way to expand your knowledge about the inner mechanisms of Linux.</p>
